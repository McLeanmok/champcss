/* 
    The gap plug-in is a collection of classes that are used to set gaps between elements. 
    It includes classes for setting gaps between block elements, inline elements, and between block and inline elements.
    These utility classes are added in the "champ-gap" layer which adds zero specificity. If you need to override these classes, add them to the "custom-gap" layer in this file.

    Here's how it works:
    - gaps are defined by the 'gap' prefix, followed by the size of the gap. The sizes are sm, md, lg and xl. For example, if I wanted to set a small gap between elements, I would use the class `gap-sm`.
    - there's also classes for contextual gaps like: contaner-gap, card-gap, and grid-gap. These classes are used to set gaps between elements in specific contexts. for example, if I wanted to add a gap within my grid, I would use the class `grid-gap`.
